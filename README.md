# hello-world
My First GitHub!
Hello, my name is Alex Villier and I am a Computer Science major at Louisiana State University. 
I love programming and am very enthusiastic about the field! I have made several video games and 
a few apps both for school projects and just for fun.
Currently I am working on a research project with a professor at LSU to make an app for smartphones
that will improve the lives of students at LSU by making the boring processes a little easier and more fun.
I also have a very strong interest in virtual reality, and although I have no experience yet in VR, 
I am excited at the prospect of learning.
